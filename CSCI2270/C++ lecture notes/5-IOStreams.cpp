    C++ has this great feature called streams, where information can be read
    in and out from different sources, either the keyboard, or file, and is
    treated as a stream of data. This is nice because it allows the data
    to be interpreted however the programmer wants it to be interpreted.

    Uses the iostream header, provides an interface for reading in from the
    console and writing out to the console.

    There is also a file stream object that provides similar functionality,
    but for transmitting data to and from files.
    The data being read from the file is treated as a stream of characters,
    and takes on the type it is assigned in a program.
    For example, reading in a stream of numbers from a file is still a
    bunch of 0 and 1 that are interpreted as integers if the user is reading
    it into an integer.

    /*There are three types of file stream objects.
    The ifstream for reading in from a file and the ofstream that
    writes data out to a file.
    These are objects, just like the objects we talked about in lecture.
    Instead of being an elevator or an automobile, they're ifstream and ofstream
    and have properties and methods to support reading and writing to files.
